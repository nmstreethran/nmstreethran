# Hello!

I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Geographical Information Systems. I previously studied Renewable Energy Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.

My studies focus on the intersection of renewable energy technologies, mathematical modelling, and GIS. I'm specifically interested in the planning and decommissioning phases of wind, solar, and hybrid renewable energy projects, as well as their environmental and societal impacts.

I enjoy programming (in Python, Shell scripting, and R) and typesetting in LaTeX. Among other things, I like role-playing games, nature, and all things open-source.

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to contact me if you find my profile interesting! ðŸ˜„ðŸ’š
