### Hello there! ðŸ˜„

A few things about me:

- I'm currently a master's student in Geographical Information Systems at the University of Aberdeen.
- I'm interested in using open-source software and data to enhance renewable energy development and public participation in environmental decision making.
- Some tools I use to handle, analyse, and visualise spatial and temporal data are Python, R, and QGIS.
- I'm also familiar with shell scripts and command line interfaces in Linux and Microsoft Windows.
- I enjoy role-playing and story-rich games, nature walks, and typesetting in LaTeX.
- I've lived in Malaysia, Norway, and the UK.
- I can speak English, Malay, and Tamil; I know some basic Norwegian (BokmÃ¥l) and am interested in learning Scottish Gaelic.
- My pronouns are she/her.

Thank you for stopping by, and please feel free to contact me if you find my profile interesting!
